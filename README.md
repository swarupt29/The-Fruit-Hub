# The-Fruit-Hub
This Spring Boot application integrates the Fruity Vice API to deliver an interactive platform for exploring detailed information about fruits. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it allows users to access nutritional data in an engaging and user-friendly way. The application is designed to showcase the seamless integration of external APIs, emphasizing the power of Spring Boot in building robust and dynamic web applications.

## Features

To create a meaningful project, I used the Free Dictionary API from [https://www.fruityvice.com](https://www.fruityvice.com)
